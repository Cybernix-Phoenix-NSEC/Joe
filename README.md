* Then create a .env file in the root of your cloned directory and add the following line
```markdown

```
* Fire up a terminal and cd into your directory. Then execute

```
to install the packages

```markdown
nodemon index.js
```
* The bot is up and running! You can now start contributing


## What to contribute in this project?
* Fix the help command
* Implement pause command for pausing a music
* Implement resume command for resuming a music
* Implement skip command for skipping a music
* Improve the directory structure and clean up the code. The code is messy :(
* Try to implement [slash commands](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.html#before-you-continue). I know the bot works fine with a prefix, but slash commands are cool :)
